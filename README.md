# Predict which voter-eligible Colorado citizens actually voted in the 2016 US presidential election.

Welcome to the Spring, 2017, Harvard Statistics 149 (Generalized Linear Models) prediction contest/course project!

Prediction contest ends April 30, 2017, at 10pm EDT

The goal of this project is to use the modeling methods you learned in Statistics 149 (and possibly other related methods) to analyze a data set on whether a Colorado voting-eligible citizen ended up actually voting in the 2016 US election. These data were kindly provided by moveon.org. Competition can be found [here](inclass.kaggle.com/c/who-voted).
