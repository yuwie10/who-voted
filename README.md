# Predict which voter-eligible Colorado citizens actually voted in the 2016 US presidential election.

This is the Spring 2017, Harvard Statistics 149: Generalized Linear Models prediction contest/course project.

The goal of this project is to use the modeling methods you learned in Statistics 149 (and possibly other related methods) to analyze a data set on whether a Colorado voting-eligible citizen ended up actually voting in the 2016 US election. These data were kindly provided by moveon.org. Competition can be found [here](inclass.kaggle.com/c/who-voted) and ended April 30, 2017, at 10pm EDT.
